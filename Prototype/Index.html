                <h3>How Spartan Came To Be</h3>
    
                <blockquote>
                    <!--This creates a quote which is a block element, meaning it will expand across the width of the entire webpage-->
                    <p>
                        "Where did the name Spartan Cabinets come from and why did I pick it?
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I first established my business on August 19, 1998. I had chosen to name my business “Clems Cabinets”.  
                        The choice to leave out the apostrophe in my new business name was a simple one. 
                        There was a gentleman that had founded his business in his home state of California. This was sometime in the late 1950&apos;s. 
                        He was not associated with my business, but he did play a role in me starting it. 
                        I chose to include his name to honor him and the shot he gave to me to learn a new trade. 
                        While he had done this, he had thrown everything including the “kitchen sink” at me over the course of about 10 months. 
                        One day while discussing my plans he informed me that he really had nothing left to teach me. I did still have a lot to learn, just not a lot more from him. 
                        He had shown me what I needed to start building custom cabinets and that was really all I needed. Just that shot.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Now with that being said, and to not take away from the opportunity he had given me, he was basically still building cabinets like he had in the 50&apos;s and 60&apos;s. 
                        He built a great cabinet, but there was a lot of room for growth. So as I started making plans for my new business, I realized it was time for some changes. 
                        Nothing so drastic, that I couldn&apos;t recognize what I was building, but there were still changes to be made. 
                        One of the things that I knew I wanted to do was to name the business Clems. It just felt like the right thing to do. 
                        There were some things that I definitely did want to change though, like to incorporate some new cabinet styles, some new wood species and to bring in some new brands of cabinet hardware. 
                        There were many more changes, some minor while some more major. With those changes, I had a very long successful journey. The warehouse I started in, I was in for 21 years. 
                        The business name “Clems”, I also had for 21 years.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        But now let&apos;s look at 2019. I&apos;ve come to the realization that even a longstanding successful business, may be long overdue for some change.  
                        So on August 30th 2019, I moved my business into a new larger location in Searcy. This isn&apos;t the only change that I&apos;m ready to make. 
                        Another is to fully rebrand into Spartan Cabinets. I have had many people ask me where I came up with the name “Spartan Cabinets”. 
                        My answer is this, I wanted a name that stood for strength and longevity. I also wanted a name that was extremely rare for a custom cabinet shop. 
                        I printed off thousands of business names for the state of California. 
                        I would highlight any that stood out to me, and then with a few hundred Google searches I finally found one that had no known custom cabinet company affiliation. 
                        That was over 5 years ago.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        26 years and counting, I still love my profession and it always makes me smile when I hear a customer boast about their home. I can only hope that I get at least another 26 years doing this profession that has always made me proud.

                <h4>Doors</h4>
    
                <p>
                    Although cabinets may be our main focus, the first thing someone often sees when looking at a cabinet is its door. 
                    Because of this, it is vital that a cabinet has an excellent set of doors, which both function properly and set the tone for the room.
                    <em>For that reason, we create our own custom doors in house, so that we can ensure your woodworking needs are met.</em>
                    <!--This shows that the line of texts encased within should have a greater emphasis than the surrounding text, though not as much as text with the strong tag.-->
                </p>
    
                <h5>Note: There are some doors we are currently incapable of creating in house. We have vendors for these specific constructions.</h5>
    
                <h4>Molding</h4>
    
                <p>
                    We also install crown molding, saving you the need to reach out to a different contractor.
                    This also ensures that your molding matches your cabinets, saving you from any potential headaches.
                </p>
    
                <h4>Hardware</h4>
    
                <p>
                    As mentioned earlier, we utilize thousands of different pieces of hardware, allowing for unparalleled customization.
